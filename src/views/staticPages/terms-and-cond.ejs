                  health products. E.g ginger, moringa powder e.t.c then in case
                  you decide not to be a marketer, you can also make money by

                  purchased. You need to process your order with WhatsApp
                  support after purchasing any package, pay for delivery and get
                  your product delivered to you anywhere you are.

                  service, not a bureau de change platform, not a dollar
                  exchange platform, not a crypto platform and we don't demand
                  real dollars or dollar market equivalent value from our
                  customers. So we're not spending dollars, people only pay in

                  #1000 on the platform but payment are still made in naira, not
